# AI_Virtual_Keyboard_and_Mouse_using_NLP
It is a project and simulation of virtual keyboard and mouse which works on the basis of NLP. it is used using Webcam.

Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition using Neural Network is a system that will recognize the movements done by hand continuously and will perform the task stored in the database for that action. 
This system has two parts:
	Virtual Keyboard
	Virtual Mouse
Using both these features we can access the apps, open them and perform different task as performed by the mouse and with the help of keyboard we can type virtually.

We are developing a system that will recognize the dynamic movements of hand and will then perform some tasks like typing, opening an app, drawing, etc. It has two features Virtual Keyboard and Virtual Mouse. In Virtual Keyboard, we can type anything anywhere. Virtual Keyboard is necessary in a computer/laptop as sometimes we have faced issues related to keyboard that some keyboard buttons are missing or some buttons don’t work. In virtual Mouse, we can use our finger the same as a mouse but virtually. The camera will detect the movements of hand and detect its actions and will response accordingly. Both Virtual Keyboard and Virtual Mouse features will help in better human – computer interaction and will improve user Experience.
